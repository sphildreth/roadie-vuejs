          <h5 class="headline mb-0">Can I search for only Artists?</h5>
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>By default when a search is performed it searches for: Artists, Releases, Tracks and Playlists that contain the search value.</p>
          <p>You can limit to a specific type by starting the search with a type indicator like "x:", where the indicator is the first letter of the type:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>a: Artist</li>
              <li>r: Release</li>            
              <li>t: Track</li>                        
              <li>p: Playlist</li>                                    
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>You can also include a rating filter to only show matches that are equal or greater than the rating value. An Example would be "t: batman :rating 3", which would show all tracks with the word 'batman' and have a rating of 3 or more.</p>
          <p>By default all searches are contains (or like) searches you can perform a equals (or exact) search by using quotes. Here are some search examples:</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>a: Diana
                <ul>
                  <li>Find all Artists that have the word 'Diana' in their: name, sort name or alternate name.</li>
                  <li>Diana Ross</li>
                  <li>Diana Krall</li>
                  <li>Diana Washington</li>
                  <li>Dixie Diana</li>
                  <li>Diana Ross & The Supremes</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>a: "Diana Ross"
                <ul>
                  <li>Find all Artists that are named 'Diana Ross', have the sort name of 'Diana Ross' or the alternate name of 'Diana Ross'.</li>
                  <li>Diana Ross</li>
                </ul>                
              </li>
              <li>t: :rating 3
                <ul>
                  <li>Find all Tracks that have a rating of at least 3.</li>
                </ul> 
              </li>              
              <li>t: batman :rating 3
                <ul>
                  <li>Find all Tracks that have the word 'batman' in the title and have a rating of at least 3.</li>

        <v-card-text>
          <p>Under 'Account Settings' turn the 'Keep Your Activity Private' on. This prevents your play activity from being shown to others. You will still show up in statistics and reports but with no private activity data being made public.</p>

        <v-card-text>
          <p>A Playlist is a group of Tracks and a Collection is a group of Releases.</p>
          <p>'Top 100 all time best selling Albums' is an example of a Collection.</p>
          <p>'Best Workout Dance Tunes' is an example of a Playlist.</p>

          <h5 class="headline mb-0">What is the difference between Rating and Rank?</h5>
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>Rating is provided by users. Rank is calculated by the system.</p>
          <p>Release Collection Rank Value = (Releases In Collection * .01) - ((Release Collection Number - 1) * .01)</p>
          <p>Release Rank Calculation = Average of Track User Ratings + (User Rating of Release / Release Track Count) + Release Collection Rank Value</p>

        <v-card-title primary-title>
          <h5 class="headline mb-0">What is the difference between average rating and my rating?</h5>
        </v-card-title>
        <v-card-text>
          <p>When you provide a rating for something (say for example an Artist). That rating is your rating applied to that Artist. Your rating is then averaged with all the other user given ratings and the average becomes the Artist rating.</p>
          <p>It is not unusual for you to provide a rating but the average rating is less because others don't think so highly of the same thing or conversly others think better of the same thing and the average is higher than your provided rating.</p>
          <p>The average rating is calculated for all <i>user given ratings</i>. Three users played a Track; one rated it 4, one rated it 2, and the other didn't give/indicate a rating - the calculated average of that track is 3 (4+2/2) <b>not</b> 2 (4+2+0/3) as "0" is not a user given rating. The lowest user rating is 1 not 0 (0 is the value recorded for a user when the user plays the track and hasn't indicated a rating.)</p>
          Here are the rating values (given as an example for a Track):
          <ul>
            <li>0
              <ul>
                <li>No rating was recorded for the user.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>1
              <ul>
                <li>The first rank of rating.</li>
                <li>The user wouldn't mind hearing the Track again.</li>
                <li>Better than most.</li>
                <li>An energetic "MEH".</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li>2
              <ul>
                <li>The second rank of rating.</li>
                <li>Liked the Track.</li>
                <li>Definately wants to hear it again.</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li>3
              <ul>
                <li>The third rank of rating.</li>
                <li>Loved the Track.</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li>4
              <ul>
                <li>The fourth rank of rating.</li>
                <li>The Track is spectacular.</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
            <li>5
              <ul>
                <li>The highest rank of rating.</li>
                <li>The Track is one of the best ever made.</li>
                <li>A MUST listen.</li>
              </ul>              
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you rate everything either by giving no rating (0) or highest (5) you're doing it wrong and your statistics will be worthless. Please don't be worthless.</p>

            <a href="http://www.subsonic.org/pages/apps.jsp" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Applications</a> to connect via the Subsonic API layer built into Roadie. This will allow you to play tracks via the application on your mobile device (or other platforms). This is the recommended way to play tracks on the go to be able to stream via Bluetooth in automobiles to display track information on the automobiles built in stereo.
          </p>
          <p>Under your 'Account Settings' the setting 'Third Party API Token' allows you to set a 'password' to use in the Subsonic application that should be different than your user password. This way you are never supplying your real password to a third party application</p>
          <p>You would use your username you use to log into this site for the
            <b>'Username'</b> and the value you put in 'Third Party API Token' for the
            <b>'Password'</b> in the applications configuration. The
            <b>'Server address'</b> (sometimes called 'Address') setting for "{{ appName }}" is "{{ apiUrl }}/subsonic"
